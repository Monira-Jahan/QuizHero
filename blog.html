            <h2 class="card-title">Question-1 : What Is the difference between map,forEach,filter and find?</h2>
            <p> <strong>Answer:</strong> <br>
               Difference Between map,forEach,filter and find are-<br>
                <strong>Map():</strong> When the specified callback to map is finished, the elements of the original array are modified and saved into the new array, and the original array is then returned as the mapped array.<br>
                <strong>forEach():</strong>Foreach accepts a callback function and executes it on each individual array element.<br>
                  <strong>filter():</strong>ForEach and filter differ primarily in that forEach just loops through the array and executes the callback, whereas filter executes the callback and checks the return value.<br>
                  <strong>forEach():</strong>The value of the first element that passes a test is returned by the find() method, which runs a function on each element of the array.

            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> <br>
              The chooseQuiz function has 2 parameters which are called index and given. Declare a Constant variable called isExist where users find a function which checks the answer id and whether the quiz data-id is equal or not. Then it takes an if else condition where if isExist is true then enters in the for of loop when it will take an answer then break the condition and again repeat the process. Otherwise push the answer to the quizData.
              At last call the displayAnswers() function to display the answer.
